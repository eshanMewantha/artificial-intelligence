A farmer wants to move himself, a silver fox, a fat goose and some tasty grain across a river.
Unfortunately, his boat is so tiny he can take only one of his possessions across on any trip.
Worse yet, an unattended fox will eat a goose, and an unattended goose will eat grain.
So the farmer must not leave the fox alone with the goose or the goose alone with the grain. What is he to do ?
